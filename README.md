# Gravity

[![Greenkeeper badge](https://badges.greenkeeper.io/dhedegaard/gravity.svg)](https://greenkeeper.io/)

A simple experiment for trying to apply gravity forces between planets :)

Also, my first public piece of typescript.

You can see the project in action here: <https://p.dhedegaard.dk/gravity/>

For running and build it, you'll need nodejs and typescript.

```
$ npm install -g typescript gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

This'lll build a `bundle.js` containing the converted typescript concatenated together.
