# Gravity

A simple experiment for trying to apply gravity forces between planets :)

Also, my first public piece of typescript.

For running and build it, you'll need nodejs and typescript.

```
$ npm install -g typescript gulp
$ npm install
$ gulp
```

This'lll build a `bundle.js` containing the converted typescript concatenated together.
